# Explore Weather Trends

This is the introductory project for [Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree][uda-da].

The project's goal is to "analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends."

The data needed to be extracted from a database and the processed to find the moving averages of different cities. Finally, the results should be presented in a pdf file.
